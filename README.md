# Launchpad.js

There is an official Python library [launchpadlib](https://pypi.org/project/launchpadlib/) that can
help Python developers to manage [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/) via the web services interfaces. 

This package is about to support it in JavaScript, so we can call the APIs in Node.js or
Chrome extensions.
